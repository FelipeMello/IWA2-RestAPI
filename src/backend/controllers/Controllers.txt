We are going to need two controllers. Each endpoint has different requirements but all
endpoints share the following set of common requirements:
● In all your controllers, the inputs of each endpoint should be validated and an error
HTTP 400 (Bad Request) should be returned if the inputs are invalid.
● If an exception takes place an error HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) should be
returned.
● When an user doesn't have permissions to perform an operation, an error HTTP 403
(Forbidden) should be returned.
● When a request tries to access a private endpoint without a known identity, an error
HTTP 401 (Unauthorized) should be returned.
